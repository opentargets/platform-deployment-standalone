# Standalone Deployment for Open Targets Platform
This application spins up a single-node deployment of [Open Targets
Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org/). It will fetch all the necessary
resources and components and provide sane defaults so that you can get started
quickly.

## Quick start
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/opentargets/standalone-deployment-platform.git
# navigate to the project
cd standalone-deployment-platform
# set the profile
./configure 2503-testrun-3
# start the platform
make
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The first time you specify a data image in your deployment, it has to be
> downloaded. This will take a relatively long time, depending on the size of
> the image and the connection speed. Subsequent deployments with the same data
> image will not need to re-download, so they will be much faster.

## Requirements
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install) (if downloading
  releases from Google Cloud Storage)
- at least 250GB local storage (as of release 25.03)

## Resources:
1. [Open Targets data release](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/opentargets/platform)
   1. OpenSearch data
   2. ClickHouse data
2. Open Targets software
   1. [Web app](https://github.com/opentargets/ot-ui-apps)
   2. [API](https://github.com/opentargets/platform-api)
   3. [OpenAI API](https://github.com/opentargets/ot-ai-api)
3. 3rd party software
   1. [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/)
   2. [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/)


## Profiles
The `profiles` directory contains the [config files](profiles/2503-testrun-3).
These are small bash scripts exporting a set of environment variables that are
used to configure deployments. With them, you can combine standard software and
data releases with your own custom images for parts of the platform.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Keep in mind deploying a new profile will overwrite the current deployment!


### Fields
An example of a profile is shown below:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

export OT_RELEASE="25.03-testrun-3"

export OT_DATA_URL="gs://open-targets-pre-data-releases/$OT_RELEASE/disk_images"

## Usage
The deployment is managed by a `configure` script to set a profile, and a
`Makefile` that provides a set of commands to manage the deployment. To see the
full list of commands, issue `make help`.

```
‚ùØ make help
help             show this help message
clean            clean up
start            default target: deploy the standalone deployment
stop             stop the deployment
```
